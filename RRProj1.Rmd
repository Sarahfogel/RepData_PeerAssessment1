This document assumes that you have the data downloaded and unzipped into your working directory.

###Loading and Preprocessing the Data
Begin by reading in the data.  Then convert the date column into a date format in R.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
activity<-read.csv("activity.csv")

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
