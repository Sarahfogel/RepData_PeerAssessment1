Then convert the date column into a date format in R.\n```{r, echo=TRUE}\nactivity<-read.csv(\"activity.csv\")\n\n```\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nplot(cars)\n```\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n",
